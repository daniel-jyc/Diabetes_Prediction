# Diabetes_Prediction_WebApp
This is the repository for demo web app of the diabetes prediction project.

Streamlit Server reads the app.py from the Github repository and generated it as a web application with pre-designed UI. The model we trained and used 
for the web app is the LightGBM_model.sav, which was saved, dumped, and loaded with Pickle. The requirements.txt indicates some necessary packages and 
corresponding versions, as some of the latest versions of the Streamlit package are not showing websites correctly on iPhone.
